// need signals for:
// redraw board?
// animate click
// animate flag
// animate mine
// animate move
// animate win
// animate lose

// animations signals will start playing an animation at coordinates of the board
// multiple animations will be able to play concurrently
// once all animations have finished, the board animation loop pauses until the next signal occures
// animations are queued up and played until they are all done, then it pauses.

// divide the board into an (x + 1) by (y + 1) grid, so each "intersection: of the grid state has its own animation tile?
// or do independent animations play at some board coordinates

// need a map (state coordinates) => {board render coordinates}
